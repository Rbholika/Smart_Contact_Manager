# Smart Contact Manager

Smart Contact Manager is an application to manage personal and business contacts — add, edit, delete, search and organize contacts. This README is a draft and should be updated to reflect the repository's actual implementation details (languages, frameworks, build tools, exact commands, environment variables, database schema, and endpoints).

## Project overview

Smart Contact Manager helps you store and manage contacts with ease. Typical features include contact creation, editing, deletion, search/filtering, grouping/tags, and import/export capabilities. It can run locally for development or be deployed to a server.

> Replace this overview with an accurate summary after examining the code (web app vs desktop vs mobile, back-end framework, front-end framework).

## Features

- Add, edit and delete contacts
- List and paginate contacts
- Search and filter contacts by name, email, phone, or tags
- Grouping or tagging contacts
- Import/Export (CSV, vCard) — if implemented
- User authentication and authorization — if implemented
- Responsive UI (if web frontend included)

(Adjust above to match implemented features.)

## Tech stack

Replace or confirm the items below with actual stack used in this repository:
- Backend: (e.g., Java + Spring Boot / Node.js + Express / Python + Django / etc.)
- Frontend: (e.g., React / Angular / Vue / Thymeleaf / plain HTML)
- Database: (e.g., PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB / SQLite / H2)
- Build tools: (e.g., Maven / Gradle / npm / yarn)
- Runtime: (e.g., JDK 17, Node 18)
- Testing: (unit / integration frameworks)
- Docker: (if Dockerfile / docker-compose present)

## Getting started

These are generic setup steps. Replace commands and version numbers with ones appropriate for the project.

### Requirements

- Git
- Appropriate runtime (e.g., Java 17, Node 18+, Python 3.10+)
- Database (if not embedded): PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB
- Optional: Docker and Docker Compose

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rbholika/Smart_Contact_Manager.git
cd Smart_Contact_Manager
```

### Backend (example)

If the project is a Java Spring Boot app:

```bash
# Build
./mvnw clean package   # or ./gradlew build

# Run
./mvnw spring-boot:run  # or java -jar target/<app>.jar
```

If the project is Node.js:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev   # or npm start
```

### Frontend (example)

If there's a separate frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run start
```

### Database

If the project requires a DB, create a database and update connection settings in the appropriate config or environment file (e.g., application.properties, .env).

## Configuration

List and set required environment variables or config files:

- DATABASE_URL / SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL
- DATABASE_USERNAME
- DATABASE_PASSWORD
- JWT_SECRET (if auth)
- PORT (optional)

Add example .env or application.properties snippets here once repo is inspected.

## Running tests

Replace with actual test commands:

```bash
# Backend tests
./mvnw test        # or ./gradlew test
# or
npm test

# Frontend tests
npm test
```

## Docker

If a Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml is present, use:

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t smart-contact-manager .

# Or use docker-compose
docker-compose up --build
```

## Deployment

- Provide deployment steps here (Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Add CI/CD notes if workflows are included (GitHub Actions)

## Project structure

Include the actual repo structure after inspection. Example:

- backend/ - server-side code
- frontend/ - client-side code
- database/ - migrations or seeds
- docs/ - documentation
- scripts/ - helper scripts

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/my-feature
3. Commit your changes: git commit -m "Add feature"
4. Push to the branch: git push origin feature/my-feature
5. Open a pull request

Include code style and testing requirements after reviewing existing repo conventions.

## License

Specify the license used in the repository (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0). If none, add one or ask the maintainer.

If you'd like, I can now:
- Attempt to read the repository files again and update this README to match the actual code, or
- Generate a README tailored to the project if you paste the list of files or core files (pom.xml/package.json, main application files, README notes, or server and client entry points).
Please tell me how you'd like to proceed.
